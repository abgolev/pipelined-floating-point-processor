# pipelined-floating-point-processor
Verilog implementation of a five-stage floating point pipelined processor based on the PinKY instruction set. This implementation is able to handle conditional and dependencies as well as jumps. 

The PinKY assembly lan- guage is a simple architecture with a variety of similarities to ARM that was built by Prof. Hank Dietz specifically for use by the University of Kentuckyâ€™s EE480 courses.
